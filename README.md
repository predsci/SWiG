## OVERVIEW ##
  
`SWiG` is a python code that generates emperical solar wind solutions (WSA or DCHB) using potential field source surface (PFSS) and current sheet (CS) models of the coronal magnetic field.
  
SWiG includes POT3D and MAPFL as submodules, both of which are required to be built for SWiG to work.
